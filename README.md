# line_curve_fit
A notebook showing how you can use curve_fit to fit a line to data

There are other, simpler and faster ways of doing this (np.polyfit or scipy.stats.linregress), but then curve_fit can be used to fit more complex functions, so if you know how to use it you can fit many more fucntions.
